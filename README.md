# Adoptera Husdjur


## Description

Welcome to Adoptera Husdjur! This is the first project and it's a part of the course "Webbserverprogrammering 1", curriculum year 23/24. 

The project is a web application built with the Flask framework. It provides a platform where users can browse through a list of pets available for adoption. Each pet has a profile page with details such as name, age, breed, and a short description. Users can also submit a form to express their interest in adopting a pet.

The application uses many different functions that are present in "class" functions in Python, such as instances, classes, modules, and `__name__`. For routing, the project utilizes Flask's `route`, `request`, `response`, and `endpoints`.

Whether you're looking for a furry friend or want to find a loving home for a pet, this application is here to help.
